# e-commerce-back-end-pedro-guerra

## Description

In this bootcamp challenge, the main goal is to work on a code in order to successfully display the back end for an e-commerce site. There is already a starter code given,
therefore some of the work has already been done. In this particular challenge, an Express.js API will be utilitized, and we will have to configure it in order for it to
use sequelize in order to interact with a MySQL database.

## Installation

If an user is having issues with the code when starting up the server, try typing "npm i" first into the terminal, and that should then download all required packages
in order to allow the application to fully work.

## Usage

This challenged allowed me to improve my JavaScript, Express & MySQL coding skills. This back end application will allow an user to see the back end for an e-commerce site through an Express.js API.
